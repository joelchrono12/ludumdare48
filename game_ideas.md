# Game Jam Ludum Dare 48
# Theme: Deeper and deeper
# Starting time: 8:56, 13 hours after the theme was announced

# Game ideas

- A game similar to S.O.S from the snes, a cruiser is sinking into the ocean and you are doing your best to escape from it.
- You have some kind of jackhammer, and you are trying to go down to the earth while trying to avoid something
- A game where you are mining, looking for water for your town.
- A game where you free the waters of the deep. The Deep Fountains talked about in the Bible and other myths

# CHOSEN IDEA

- You live in a future, humanity lives in floating cities, an alien spaceship caused everything to fall apart. Now you have to go and go down to the surface

# Game mechanics

- Different stages with different environments
- You have some backpack that allows you to glide
- You can wall jump with the help of the backpack, walljumps waste more gas due to quick bursts


# Challenges to overcome

- Make a character that has a parachute and can do little bursts
- Make still platforms
- Make falling platforms 
- Make platforms that fall when stepped on
- Make it progresively difficult
- Maybe make stages
- Make the parachute / jetpack work with batteries or something
