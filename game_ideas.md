- A game similar to S.O.S from the snes, a cruiser is sinking into the ocean and you are doing your best to escape from it.
- You have some kind of jackhammer, and you are trying to go down to the earth while trying to avoid something
- A game where you are mining, looking for water for your town.
- A game where you free the waters of the deep. The Deep Fountains talked about in the Bible and other myths
